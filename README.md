# Overview

This project demonstrates the Kotlin programming language by implementing a Connect 4 game. The goal of this software is to provide a visual representation of the game, allowing players to drop tokens and compete against each other. The project aims to showcase Kotlin's features and syntax in a practical application.

The purpose of writing this software is to further my learning as a software engineer. By working on this project, I aimed to strengthen my understanding of Kotlin's object-oriented programming concepts, GUI development using Swing, and game logic implementation. It also served as an opportunity to practice problem-solving and enhance my coding skills.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, the following tools were used:
- Kotlin programming language
- IntelliJ IDEA - an integrated development environment for Kotlin
- Swing - a Java GUI toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces

# Useful Websites

The following websites were helpful in completing this project:

- [Kotlin Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html) - Official documentation for the Kotlin programming language.
- [Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/index.html) - Official documentation for the Java programming language, which Kotlin is built upon.
- [Oracle Swing Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/) - Documentation for Swing, providing guidance on creating graphical user interfaces in Java.

# Future Work

There are several areas for improvement and future enhancements in this project:

- Implement an AI player to play against the user.
- Add sound effects and background music to enhance the gaming experience.
- Implement a scoring system and leaderboard to track high scores.
- Allow players to customize the game settings, such as the board size and winning conditions.
- Implement different game modes, such as timed matches or tournament mode.
- Enhance the visual appearance of the game by adding animations and effects.

By addressing these future work items, the Connect 4 game can be further enhanced and provide an even more engaging and customizable experience for players.
